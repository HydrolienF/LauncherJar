Currently it need to have some file on the project:
- README.md
- LICENSE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- .mvn/jvm.config
- tools/icon.png
- tools/icon.ico
- tools/icon.icns

Icon are png for Linux, ico for Windows & icns for Mac. You can provide the 3 files icons or just some.

Check [a simple project using LauncherJar](https://github.com/HydrolienF/Infanlaboro) if you need help.

Exemple use auto version tool based on branch name that should be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1.1, 1.2 etc
